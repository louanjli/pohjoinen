This repository documents an ongoing artistic research project titled **"Magnetic North — Visualising Global Runway Magnetic Deviation"**, developed for the **MUU Helsinki Contemporary Art Centre Open Call 2026**, under the theme _“Missä on pohjoinen” / “Where is the North.”_  

This work uses open geospatial data from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/data/) and the [NOAA World Magnetic Model](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-magnetic-model/) to explore how runways are oriented according to magnetic vs. true north. It includes both a **canvas print (300 × 150 cm)** and an **SVG-based HTML animation loop**, created through a combination of Python and front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/JS).  

Although the project uses aviation data and magnetic declination models, it **does not aim to serve as a scientific or aviation industry reference**. I am a **visual artist and creative technologist**, working independently and engaging with code as a conceptual tool. The process involves learning, experimentation, and AI-assisted problem solving.  

Recent updates include a technical **correction of runway magnetic headings**, which is still being refined. Due to the scale of the dataset and complexities in global geomagnetic calculations, full precision cannot be guaranteed at this stage. The project remains a **work in progress**, and future iterations may include further refinement.

👉 The intention is artistic: to question spatial certainty, orientation, and migration through the lens of data, code, and visual storytelling.
